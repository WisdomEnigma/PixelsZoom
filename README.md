# Our apporach:

I build algorithm that resize image of any size. However issue is that we resize image with pixels value and thousand of pixels resize with in a sec. Now the challenge is to regenerate the image through vector. For better view, imagine you will zoom on face of your friend. Reszizer will do that for you with in timeframe which is too short. Review my codebase and send feedback to me.
